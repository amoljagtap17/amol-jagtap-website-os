This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

Follow the quick start guide from the below URL to setup clerk authentication

[https://clerk.com/docs/quickstarts/nextjs](https://clerk.com/docs/quickstarts/nextjs)

I have used sign up and sign in options. Replace as per your need.

Rename `.env_template.txt` to `.env
`

Update the environment variables accordingly.

To generate prisma client run the following command

```bash
npx prisma generate
```

To populate the Mongo database with seed data, run the following command

```bash
npm run prisma:seed
```

The above command would run the seed script from `prisma/seed.ts`

Install npm dependencies using the following command

```bash
npm install
```

Run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.
